### running

___

this file is where i track all of my running data. the data comes from the nike run club app, which i hand-input into a google sheet which i think use the `googlesheets4` r package to import that data into r to do all analysis. there isn't much here, it's mostly just me messing around with it and trying to make interesting visuals. it has been nice in the past for me to efficiently track data such as what my current running streak is, or it was very helpful in december 2021 as i was trying to achieve my goal of 1,000 miles for the year - the file helped me determine how much i needed to run and how often to reach my goal
